This project scrapes and analyzes Philippine party-list election results from 1998 to 2025, with a focus on metadata such as ideology, leadership, and political positioning. The core scraper is located in the partylist_scraper/ folder, using Scrapy spiders like partylist_template.py to extract structured vote data from Wikipedia templates and partylist_attributes.py to gather infobox metadata such as ideology and founding figures. After scraping, the data is cleaned and deduplicated using normalize_attributes.py, then merged using merge_cleaned_results.py to align party metadata with yearly vote outcomes. Exploratory analysis and plots are handled by scripts like visualize.py, plot_political_position_trends.py, and visualize_progressive_trends.py, which help visualize shifts in ideological representation and left-progressive participation over time. The main dataset outputs include partylist_template.csv (vote results), partylist_attributes_cleaned.json (cleaned party metadata), and merged_partylist_with_links.csv (final joined dataset). A debug notebook, debug_partylist.ipynb, is included for inspecting raw HTML files during development. The project is built in Python and uses libraries such as Scrapy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter for data processing and visualization.
